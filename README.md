# DisasterResponseProject 
The project aims at analysing and classifying input messages into multiple output categories to diagnose and inform an emergency worker the degree and type of disaster response needed related to the message given.  

The goal is to develop a web interface for teh emergency worker to input the message.  

An ETL and ML pipelines are developed to train a classifer on a series of labelled message data. The trained model powers the web app.
